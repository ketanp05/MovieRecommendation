# MovieRecommendation

Recommendation Systems: 
ML algorithm will learn our likes and recommend what option would be best for us. 

These learning algorithms are getting accurate as time passes.

Types:

1) Collaborative Systems: predict what you like based on other similar users have liked in the past

2) Content-Based: predict what you like based on what you have liked in the past
eg:Netflix combines both approaches to predict your likes more accurately

app: this script reads in a dataset of movie ratings and recommends new movies for users

Dependencies: numpy, scipy, lightfm

lightfm: helps in performing bunch of recommendation algos,a great lib to start with for building recommendation systems
